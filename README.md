# tensorflow2-examples
(Maybe) helpful TensorFlow 2.0 examples. 

The idea is to provide examples on how to build deep learning models, both with jupyter notebooks and .py codes.

Even for similar datasets (e.g., mnist and fashion_mnist) we will provide distinct codes.

I will also provide links for Google Colab notebooks of stable versions of all jupyter notebooks.
