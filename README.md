# tensorflow2-examples
(Maybe) helpful TensorFlow 2.0 examples. 

The idea is to provide examples on how to build deep learning models, both with notebooks and .py codes.

Even for similar datasets (e.g., mnist and fashion_mnist) we will provide distinct codes.

(For quick tests and to avoid installation issues, you can download the notebooks and open in your Google Colab)
